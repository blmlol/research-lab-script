Author's note: These functions can be generalized to work with other data sets and file types, but since the format of the files was guaranteed to be systematically organized and would thus be the same for each file, I was able to write functions that did not require regular expressions (this would generalize the function to be able to parse through multiple data types with varying column names and number) but instead had specific column indexes (as seen in lines 26, 27, 38-41, 54, 58, 59, 128, 130). 

This is a list of steps for the task at hand and where it is accomplished in the script below:
First, read in the data (need a for loop to get these files, though the for loop will be all wrapped up) (read_me_in function)

Next, analyze the data and remove highly flourescent wells (zfluor function)

Next, Reorganize the data file while keeping certain columns but having removed these highly fluorescent wells (removefluor function)

Make sure it's the right format to put into CDD; name it library_CDD (all_fluor_read function lines 137,138)
Also, the CDD_input file will be one per library(rbind all of the individual ones) (all_fluor_read function lines 129,130)



###Make a function to read in the files from one folder
```{r}
# "C:/Users/Davey Wong/Desktop"
read_me_in <- function (directory, library_index) {#directory is folder location of all the files
  file_in <- read.delim(paste(paste(directory, library_index, sep = '/'), 'txt', sep = '.'), header = FALSE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
  zframe <- data.frame(file_in[6:389,])
  mynameiswhat <- file_in [5,]
  names(zframe) <-  mynameiswhat
  return(zframe)
}
```


###Make a function to compute z-scores of fluorescent levels compared to columns 2 and 23 
```{r}
zfluor <- function(x){#x here is the read-in file
  z_list <- list()
  aver_intens <- mean(as.numeric(unlist(x[26]))[c(17:32, 353:368)])
  sd_intens <- sd(as.numeric(unlist(x[26]))[c(17:32, 353:368)])
  for(i in 1:length(as.numeric(unlist(x[26])))){
    z_list[i] <- (as.numeric(unlist(x[26]))[i] - aver_intens)/sd_intens 
  }
  return(as.vector(z_list))
}
```

###Function that removes fluorescent wells (higher than threshold (maybe just higher and not below z-score)) Good to go
#Also want to remove wells with 0 in it (check each column if it is 0)
```{r}
removefluor <- function(file, x, crit) {#x here will be a zfluor output
  remdata <- unlist(x)
  if(sum(x > 5, na.rm = TRUE) == 0 )
  {
    return (file[,c(which(names(file)=="Well Name") ,4,26,27,32,33)])
  }
  else 
  {
    remdat <- file[-(which(remdata > crit)),  c(which(names(file)=="Well Name"),4,26,27,32,33)]
    names(remdat) <- names(file)[c(which(names(file) == "Well Name"),4,26,27,32,33)]
  
  }
  return(remdat)
}
```

#Making the library of library names (May have to remove some of the names if the files for them don't exist)
```{r}
write_lib <- function(x, plate, number)
{
  for(i in 1:number)
  {
    x[i] <- paste(plate, i, sep = '-')
  }
  return(x)
}

NIHII <- unlist(write_lib(NIHII, 'NIHII', 3))
```
#Let's have a set list for the library list and the library names
#This is the FULL LIST
```{r}
execlib <- list(DL,EAM,ES,LC,LCI,LOPAC,LS,MS,NIHII,NPW,SS,TAR,UCLA)
